      <h3> About Me : </h3>
      <p class="red_font"> I really enjoy playing badminton, I play at least 5 hours a week. I also go for a run with my dog, Kiki, who is a chihuahua mix. I hate running, but I do it for my dog <3. I love lychee, mango, and watermelon. Iâ€™m addicted to milk tea too. This coming fall, I'll be a senior :D I'm super excited to use some skills that I've learned here from GWC in school too! This program is very special to me because I've met some friends that I finally feel comfortable with, and all the girls here are unique and so nice! </p>
